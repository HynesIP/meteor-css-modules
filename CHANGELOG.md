## [2.0.1] - 2016-06-20
### Changed

## [2.0.0] - 2016-06-20
### Added
- Changelog file is now included in the repo

### Changed
- node-sass, stylus, and sugarss are now user installed dependencies; they are still supported, but the npm packages are no longer bundled with the CSS modules package.
They must now be installed using `meteor npm install`.
Once installed, their behavior is unchanged: Sass and Stylus compilation require the `extensions` property to be set, and sugarss requires the `parser` option to be set.
See [the wiki](https://github.com/nathantreid/meteor-css-modules/wiki) for more details.
- Stylus now supports both .styl and m.styl extensions by default (the previous default was m.styl)
